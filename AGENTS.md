# Agent guide for RackBrain

## Repository overview

- Documentation lives in `README.md` and `config/**/*.md`.
- Configuration examples live under `config/` and should stay free of secrets.

## Contribution notes

- Keep documentation changes focused on clarity and accuracy.
- Wrap long lines in Markdown at ~100 characters for readability.
- Do not add secrets, tokens, or credentials to the repo.

## Testing

- No automated test suite is required for documentation-only changes.
